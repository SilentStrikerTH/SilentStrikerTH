- 👋 Hi, I’m @SilentStrikerTH!
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a better understanding of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, taking a class from Pierian Data. I will soon be looking to learn networking through CCNA as well as C#.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment, just expanding upon my abilities.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me I guess haha.
