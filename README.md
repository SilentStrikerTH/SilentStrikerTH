- 👋 Hi, I’m @SilentStrikerTH!
- 👀 I’m an IT professional and a hobby programmer! In my free time, I work on my home server, find new ways to automate tasks, and brick my main linux distro by installing pip packages outside of a venv (not arch btw).
- 🌱 I am confident in Python, C#, JavaScript, Bash, and dabble in much more. I enjoy writing programs and scripts that make life easier or more streamlined. I am always interested in growing my skills and challenging myself, sometimes with Leet Code I cant begin to comprehend.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment, just expanding upon my abilities.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me I guess haha.
